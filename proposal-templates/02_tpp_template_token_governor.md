# **TITLE: [TIP #] Proposal Title**

Follow this template for new Token Program proposals, removing this text and replacing the title with your proposal's own. Proposals can be submitted via Tally or other governance applications supporting ZKsync governance.

> ℹ️ Please check the last TPP on Tally to assign the appropriate number to your proposal.

## **Simple Summary**

Add a one-sentence summary of the proposal.

## Abstract

Use this initial section to provide a ~250 word summary of the proposal. This summary should include about 2-4 paragraphs explaining the vision, impact, mechanic, and accountability of the Token Program you are proposing.

This information should be simple, direct, and in accessible language. Describe the problem that the Token Program addresses, and how it contributes to Assets, Builders, and Community of the ZKsync protocol.

Lastly, make sure to highlight key risks, dependencies, or limitations of the Token Program, as well as how they are addressed.

## Impact

Describe how the Token Program will impact assets, builders, and the community of ZKsync, and what future vision these changes will contribute to. Will the Token Program increase the number or quality of assets on ZKsync? Maybe it will increase the number of funded teams using ZKsync as a core technology? Or instead, could it bring new communities of users?

This section could be between 300-500 words. Make sure to describe what specific metrics your Token Program will impact, why it will impact them, and how the metrics will change based on the outcomes of your Token Program.

## **Mechanic**

Token Programs should deploy self-executing smart-contracts that are designed to distribute tokens autonomously based on predefined conditions or metrics ("mechanics"). Specify the mechanism of the Token Program, and how it creates a flywheel of activity, development, or growth. 

This section should include a description of the program’s technical design. This could include smart-contracts, interfaces, and user-experience flows. Some guiding questions:

- How does the ZK Token contribute to the realization of the Token Program?
- What evidence exists to support the expected outcomes of the Token Program?
- What is the token model of the Token Program? (Amount of tokens needed, stream design)
- What onchain actions will the Token Program require or execute?
- If applicable, how does the Token Program build on current programs and token mechanics?
- If applicable, how can others contribute to the Token Program’s outcomes permissionlessly?

> ℹ️ The mechanic should include all allocations within the Token Program, including any retroactive funding for the development of the program’s smart-contracts (i.e., mechanic usage fees).

## **Plan**

Describe the proposed Token Program structure, operations, timeline, and other design components.

- What is the Token Program’s strategy, outcomes, deliverables, milestones, operational plan, progress reporting plans, team structure, and oversight process?
- What are the KPIs and metrics related to the Token Program? How will they be measured?
- How many ZK tokens are allocated to operations, analytics, interfaces, and implementation?

## Accountability Framework

Specify what methods will hold the program, operations, and participants accountable for their commitments. For example, this can include items such as an Accountability Council, Token Streaming Terms, KYC, reputation, and/or staking.

Describe what accountability mechanisms guard how ZK Tokens are used, distributed, and returned based on the Token Program’s performance.

## Participants
> ℹ️ Token Program recipients & entities will be required to KYC/KYB based on ZKsync Association policy. Proposal beneficiaries are encouraged to start the KYC/KYB process while the proposal is in its initial stages of development.

Proposer and builder profiles, certifications, KYC / KYB.

Accountability Council profiles if applicable.
